# Fake-News-Detection
With the alarming increase in the number of social media platforms, the rate and the amount
of fake news that is circulated is increasing exponentially. In recent times, we have noticed
multiple sources spreading fake news and rumours about the novel coronavirus. A study in
Sage's International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions' journal, found that
there were 9657 pieces of misinformation in 138 countries from January 2020 to March 1,
2021. The study found that social media produces 85% of fake news and internet-based sources
make up 91% of all Covid-related fake news. By employing the techniques of Natural
Language Processing, there are certain features that can be extracted and prove to be essential
in order to detect news that is synthetic and fake in nature. It is thus used to differentiate
between true and fabricated news. The project aims to implement various NLP algorithms and
models in order to classify the input news as Fake or Real.

 developed and presented an advanced Sentiment Analysis model to predict
whether some news are fake or real. We have implemented Logistic Regression, SVC ,
Random Forest , Decision Tree , Multinomial Naïve Bayes , Bernoulli Naïve Bayes.
